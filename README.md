# Churn Prediction – BCG X Data Science Competition

This repository contains the solution developed for a Data Science competition judged by BCG X. The objective was to build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and a robust data pipeline.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference scripts. The project was completed as part of a competition and is no longer actively developed.

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **inference/**: Scripts and utilities for running model inference on new data.
- **main/**: Main scripts to execute the pipeline or key project steps.
- **modelling/**: Code for model training, validation, and prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcolomele/churn_bcgx.git
   cd churn_bcgx
   ```
2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies as required by your workflow.

3. Explore the `main/` directory for entry-point scripts to reproduce results or run the pipeline.

## Data

- The `data/` directory contains all datasets used in the project.
- Raw data is stored separately from processed data to ensure reproducibility.

## Modeling

- All model development, training, and evaluation scripts are located in the `modelling/` directory.
- The code is modular to allow for easy experimentation with different algorithms and features.

## Inference

- The `inference/` directory contains scripts to apply the trained model to new data and generate predictions.

## Supplementary Materials

- Additional documentation, figures, or resources can be found in the `supplementary/` directory.

## Results

- The final model achieved strong performance in predicting customer churn, as evaluated by the competition metrics.
- For more details, refer to the documentation in the `supplementary/` folder.
