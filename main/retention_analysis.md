# Analysis
Looking at the customers who have not churned yet.

## Probability of churning
- data and visuals from notebook

## Risk Categories
- monetary value
– next month revenue: at risk, expected

## Confirmation of initial diagnostic research

# Intervention Strategy
The intervention strategies we recommend can be categorised along two axis; complexity and time horizon.

Complexity defines the deph and personalisation of the intervention strategy. Fundamentally, churn is a causal phenomenon peculiar to each customer. An effective intervention will target the root cause. Thus, more complex interventions will be more targeted, but also more expensive. Conversely, less complex interventions will be more general and cost less to implement.

Time horizon defines when to implement the intervention strategy. Short term strategies are pragmatic and data driven, should be implemented today, and will yield result in the coming months. Long term straegies are strategic and organisational, should be implemented gradually over the course over the next months, and will yield results over the course of years.  

Insert intervention strategy matrix with fancy business name for each strategy type:
– short term + complex – life saver
- short term + simple – general
- long term + complex – revolutions
– long term simple – support

upsell joke that we as consultant can implement that.

## Short term strategy
Maximise profit next month 
$\equiv$ minimise probaility of users churning. 

KPI: extend tenure to critical point.

intervene for high and medium similarly – key average differences:
- 14 months less tenure
- 8.75 more monthly charge
- 0.48 more anger score
- 27.50 higher mean expected loss

### Band-aid fixes - simple
for exrending tenure:
- lower price per month for longer contracts
- upsell services to increase commitment, free trial to keep costs low

### life savers - complex
special treatment for complaints
- lower anger score with ad-hoc customer care
- idenfity core probles: quick word frequency by POS. 

## Long term strategy
Improve fundamentally business, both commercial side and organisational side.

### support – simple
Augmented Data Collection - 
Marketing to grow user base, link to leaky bucket analogy to increase water inflow.

### revolutinos – complex
Tech investments into improving product, add new products similar to benefits of internet service density
Workforce expansion into improving customer care.
